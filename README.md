**_Project’s Title:_**
Rock Paper Scissors Game

**_Project description:_**
Hello geeks. It's my first real-life-based project, A very basic one made with the help of the Control structure of Python. A small guide for this game would be:

**_3Main components:_**
• ROCK 
        The rock is when you place your hand into the form of a simple fist.
• PAPER 
        The paper is when you place your hand in an outstretched position.
• SCISSORS 
        This is when you hold your fist with your index and middle finger pointing outwards in a V shape.

**_The Purpose of Rock Paper Scissors_**

Apart from being a fun pastime, RPS is also played in situations where a decision needs to be made, similar to flipping a coin, rolling dice, or drawing straws. The game’s simplicity and unpredictability make it a satisfying way to resolve disputes without the possibility of error or conflict.

**_The Basic Rules of RPS_**

Despite its underlying complexity, the game’s rules are straightforward. Players deliver hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors, with the outcome determined by these three rules:

• Rock wins against scissors.
• Scissors win against the paper.
• Paper wins against the rock.
