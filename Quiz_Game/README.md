Solar System Quiz Game

*__Project Description:__*

Hello geeks. It's a real-life-based project made with the help of Conditional statements in Python. 
Here you can play a small quiz on Solar System and at the end of the quiz you will be getting the no. of correct questions you answered and the percentage of your result too. :) 

*__Project Instructions:__*

• Step 1: The user will be asked whether they want to play or not. So they have to choose between a simple yes or no.

• Step 2: A series of questions will begin and the user has to answer them. Take note- No options would be provided, so be careful. 

• Step 3: After you are done playing, your total number of correct questions and percentage will be provided at the end.

As of now, only I have contributed to this project, in the future I would like to excel in my knowledge and will modify it to provide a hint option too for easy guesswork.
